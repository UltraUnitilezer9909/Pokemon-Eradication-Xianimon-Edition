# About The Project

  <summary><b>Full General Lore<b></summary>

  > - The Aether Foundation created an artificial Pokémon named "Xianimon" to cure injured Pokémon from Earth and other factions. Despite using genes from powerful Pokémon and all available knowledge, the project failed due to lack of potential and budget. Abandoned by the team, Xianimon developed self-awareness while contained. A breach occurred, and despite efforts to contain it, Xianimon's unstable genes caused rapid evolution. With the ability to distort space-time, it became a universal threat. Recognizing this, every faction united to stop the escaped Xianimon, now known as "Ahraxia."
